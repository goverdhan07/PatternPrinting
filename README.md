# PatternPrinting

### Approach - 

Pre-requisite - Use two loops - one for rows and one for coloums (consider the pattern as matrix)
1. Number of lines = Number of rows = Number of times outer loop will run.
2. Identify for every row number -
    - How many cols are there .
    - And, Types of elements in cols.(ex: * , 1 etc)
3. Print stuff at last.
4. Write one for S.0.p to break the line.
